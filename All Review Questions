What is the result of the following operation: Dict["D"]
(4, 4, 4)

5. What is an important difference between lists and tuples?
Lists are mutable tuples are not


Module 3 - Python Programming Fundamentals

1. What is the output of the following lines of code:
x=1
if(x!=1):
print('Hello')
else:
print('Hi')
print('Mike')

Hi Mike

2. What is the output of the following few lines of code ?
A=['1','2','3']
for a in A:
print(2*a)

'11' '22' '33'

3. Consider the function Delta, when will the function return a value of 1
def Delta(x):
if x==0:
y=1;
else:
y=0;
return(y)

When the input is 0

4. What is the correct way to sort the list 'B' using a method, the result should not return a new list, just change the list 'B'.
B.sort()

5. what are the keys of the of the following {'a':1,'b':2}
a,b


Module 4 - Working with Data in Python

1. What do the following lines of code do?
with open("Example1.txt","r") as file1:
FileContent=file1.readlines()
print(FileContent)

Read the file "Example1.txt"

2. What do the following lines of code do?
with open("Example2.txt","w") as writefile:
writefile.write("This is line A\n")
writefile.write("This is line B\n")

Append the file "Example2.txt"

3. What do the following lines of code do?
with open("Example3.txt","a") as file1:
file1.write("This is line C\n")

Append the file "Example3.txt"

4. What is the result of applying the following method df.head(), to the dataframe df
prints the first 5 rows of the dataframe

5. What function would you use to load a csv file in Pandas?

1. What is the result of the following lines of code?
a=np.array([0,1,0,1,0])
b=np.array([1,0,1,0,1])
a*b

array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

2. What is the result of the following lines of code?
a=np.array([0,1])
b=np.array([1,0])
np.dot(a,b)

0

3. What is the result of the following lines of code?
a=np.array([1,1,1,1,1])
a+10

array([11, 11, 11, 11, 11])

4. What is the correct code to perform matrix multiplication on the matrix A and B?
np.dot(A,B)
